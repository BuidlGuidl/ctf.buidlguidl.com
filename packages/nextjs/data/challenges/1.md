# #1: The Greeting

Welcome Player. This is the first challenge for the BuidlGuidl CTF game.

Interact with the Challenge #1 contract and register yourself as a player.

Upon completion of a challenge, you will capture (mint) a NFT flag and earn points. Each flag must be minted to the registered Ethereum address for the points to be counted properly.

Try to complete as many challenges as possible and get all the flags back from the Solidity Invaders!

## Player Progress

Check your progress by visiting `/profile/{YourRegisteredAddress}`.

You may also connect your registered Ethereum address to this website and view your progress by clicking on "My Flags".

- After Challenge #1, you may complete the other challenges in any order.
